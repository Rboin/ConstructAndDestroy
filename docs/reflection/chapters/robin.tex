sure you give concrete examples instead of vague observations.

\subsection{Contributions}
I contributed mostly to the backend of our game. I set up the initial 
project, with the base- and movingentity, the rendering with SDL2 and the 
documentation with \LaTeX. I also wrote the initial framework for 
Goal-driven behaviours, including the Think goal, and some steering 
behaviours such as the Seek- and Arrivebehaviour. 

Secondly, I made sure to split our game into three different projects, 
namely the logic, rendering and UI projects. I did this to create a better 
overview of our project and to create a divide between gamelogic and 
rendering/ui. Besides the better overview, it also gave us a way to switch to 
OpenGL more easily, if we so desired, because the rendering is completely 
seperate from the actualy game logic. I'm very happy with this divide, even 
though I could've handled the updating of the other branches (on github) 
better.

I also made it possible to create UI elements, such as panels, buttons and 
text. SDL2 is just a simple rendering library which supplies 
you with a window handle and a renderer, so I came up with a way for us to 
create these UI elements. Besides the UI elements, I also wrote the event 
system, which includes event dispatchers and a way to hook up a UI element 
to an event. The way the UI framework and event system turned out, I'm pretty 
happy with. It's really extensible because of the composite pattern used, and 
simple to use.
Also, I wrote a wrapper that handles the rendering to textures and the 
screen, with different back buffers for the UI and the world/entities. I 
think this simplified the rendering logic a lot, since you don't have to copy 
your own texture to the correct back buffer anymore.

The Camera, with corresponding manager class, is also written by me, the 
camera makes it possible to move around within the world, to zoom and it's 
also used for transforming world coordinates into screen coordinates. I'm 
very happy with how the camera turned out. First we just had a static world, 
which was just the initial screen, but now the screen and world coordinates 
are seperated and we can create larger maps.

I also wrote the wave system and corresponding panel with button. 
The creation of the panel, button and click event was really simple, because 
I have extensive knowledge about how our UI framework works, since I wrote it.
Making the wave system was more difficult, because I had to use multiple 
timers for the preparation stages and spawning stages.

Besides the material contributions that I have made, I also supported my teammates 
when they had difficulties using the UI or rendering frameworks. I tried to 
help and give feedback when someone got stuck on a problem.

Overall I'm very happy with my contributions, I feel like I contributed a lot 
to the backend and over quality of our game and programming. The things that 
I programmed, I tried to do the best I could by researching a lot and reading 
about how other people approached those problems.
