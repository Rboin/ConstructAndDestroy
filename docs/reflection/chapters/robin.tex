\subsection{Contributions}
I contributed mostly to the backend of our game. I set up the initial 
project, with the base- and movingentity, the rendering with SDL2 and the 
documentation with \LaTeX. I also wrote the initial framework for 
Goal-driven behaviours, including the Think goal, and some steering 
behaviours such as the Seek- and Arrivebehaviour. 

Secondly, I made sure to split our game into three different projects, 
namely the logic, rendering and UI projects. I did this to create a better 
overview of our project and to create a divide between gamelogic and 
rendering/ui. Besides the better overview, it also gave us a way to switch to 
OpenGL more easily, if we so desired, because the rendering is completely 
seperate from the actual game logic and UI. I'm very happy with this divide, 
even though I could've handled the updating of the other branches (on github) 
better.

I also made it possible to create UI elements, such as panels, buttons and 
text. SDL2 is just a simple rendering library which supplies 
you with a window handle and a renderer, so I came up with a way for us to 
create these UI elements. Besides the UI elements, I also wrote the event 
system, which includes event dispatchers and a way to hook up a UI element 
to an event. The way the UI framework and event system turned out, I'm pretty 
happy with. It's really extensible because of the composite pattern used, and 
simple to use.
Also, I wrote a wrapper that handles the rendering to textures and the 
screen, with different back buffers for the UI and the world/entities. I 
think this simplified the rendering logic a lot, since you don't have to copy 
your own texture to the correct back buffer anymore. Instead, you can now 
send an image to the backbuffer or use SDL2's RenderDraw functions, and 
it will be applied to the correct back buffer.

The Camera, with corresponding manager class, is also written by me, the 
camera makes it possible to move around within the world, to zoom and it's 
also used for transforming world coordinates into screen coordinates. I'm 
very happy with how the camera turned out. First we just had a static world, 
which was just the initial screen, but now the screen and world coordinates 
are seperated and we can create larger maps.

I also wrote the wave system and corresponding panel with button. 
The creation of the panel, button and click event was really simple, because 
I have extensive knowledge about how our UI framework works, since I wrote it.
Making the wave system was a little bit more difficult, because I had to use 
multiple timers for the different stages of a wave and it was hard to keep 
track of those timers while programming.

Besides the material contributions that I have made, I also supported my 
teammates when they had difficulties using the UI or rendering frameworks or 
just C++ in general. I tried to help and give feedback when someone got 
stuck on a problem.

Overall I'm very happy with my contributions, I feel like I contributed a lot 
to the backend, the overall quality of our game and programming. The things 
that I programmed, I tried to do the best I could by researching a lot and 
reading about how other people approached those problems.

\subsection{Qualities}
Qualities that I think I have shown during this project are:

\textbf{Helpful.} Whenever someone asked for my help I tried to do this as best 
as I could. If I didn't know how to resolve a problem immediately, I hopped on to 
the other's branch and tried to resolve the problem by looking through his 
programming and giving pointers on what could be wrong or how to proceed from 
the current state.

\textbf{Self-sufficient.} I 

\textbf{Productive.}

\subsection{New Goals}
Be more vigilant while reviewing, some small issues still slipped through 
the cracks, like unnecessary includes or non-initialized members.
