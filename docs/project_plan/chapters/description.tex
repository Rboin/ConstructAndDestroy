\section{Description}
In this chapter we will give a short description of the game that we are planning to make. Also, we will give more insight into the techniques we are going to use to make the game.

\subsection{Game}
We are going  make an Age of Empires like game. The reason we chose for an Age of Empire like game is that features are pretty modular. The base game is like: the player is going to have workers from various classes to collect different resources. The resources can be used to extend his village/city and build more units. ~\\
We are going to focus on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Building a settlement
  \item Starting with a static view
  \item Controlling the game feels somewhat intuitive
  \item Controlling units, e.g. sending workers to get resources
  \item GUI
  \item Scripting (new technique for us)
\end{itemize}

If we have enough time we also are going to make an AI player so that the player can compete with him. Other features like:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Upgrading buildings
  \item Upgrading units
  \item Achieving a new age
  \item Combat system
  \item Nice graphics
  \item Smart AI
  \item Controlling the game feels natural
  \item Camera controls
\end{itemize}
could be implemented too if all goes well.

\subsection{Methods, techniques and languages}
We will program our game in C++. Also we will use the following methods and techniques.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Scrum
  \item Scripting 
  \item \LaTeX
  \item Git
  \item Steering behaviours
  \item Fuzzy Logic
  \item Goal driven behaviour
\end{itemize}
