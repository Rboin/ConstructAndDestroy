\section{Planning}
Every Monday and Tuesday we send an email our supervisor about where we will be working that day. On one of these days he will come to see us and we will discuss the progress of the project. 

The table below shows the schedule for the project.

Our sprints are two weeks long. On the first day of the sprint we make our sprint planning. Every day we will be doing a daily scrum meeting. At the end of a sprint we do a retrospective where we discuss in an informal setting what went well, what could have gone better and how we can improve.
