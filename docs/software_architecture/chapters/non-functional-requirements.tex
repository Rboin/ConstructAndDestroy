\section{Non-functional requirements}
A few non-functional requirements have been identified. These requirements are explained below.

\textbf{The game should have no significant slowdowns} \newline
A game is not fun to play when it is not able to render quickly and at a consistent speed. Therefore the player should not encounter significant slowdowns while playing the game.

\textbf{The game should start up quickly} \newline
The game should launch within one minute, so that the player does not give up and play another game that does start up quickly.

\textbf{The UI should be intuitive} \newline
We don't want the user to have to read a large manual in order to be able to play the game. Therefore the User Interface should be intuitive, and if it's not intuitive the game should teach the player how to do a specific task.

\textbf{The game should be fun to play} \newline
While we understand that this is a vague non-functional requirement, we should always ensure that the game is fun to play. Due to time constraints we can't make the game as extensive as we would like, so we should focus on features that make the game fun to play.
