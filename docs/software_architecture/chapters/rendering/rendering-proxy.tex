\subsection{Objects as a proxy}
\label{sec:rendering-proxy}

Objects that need to be rendered to the screen act as a proxy for the 
RenderObject. The only thing those objects need to do to be rendered can be 
seen in \cref{lst:rendering}. As you can see, the objects only need to return 
the result of its own RenderObject. Objects that need custom rendering logic 
can have a rendering object that derives from the SDL\_RenderObject class seen 
in \cref{fig:renderobject-inherit}.

SDL_Texture *BaseEntity::render(Renderer<SDL_Renderer> *renderer) {
    return representation->render(renderer);
}
\end{lstlisting}
