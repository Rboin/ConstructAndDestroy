\subsection{UIComponent Rendering}
\label{sec:rendering-ui}

The uicomponents need a way of rendering their child components after 
rendering themselves. You can think of the relation between child components 
and their parent as a tree in which we first render the parent and then its 
children. The code for rendering a component and its children can be 
seen in \cref{lst:uicomponent-rendering}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={UIComponent rendering.},
label={lst:uicomponent-rendering}]
void SDL_UIComponent::render(SDLRenderer *renderer, mat2 &transformations, float delta) {
    renderer->set_render_target(renderer->get_ui_buffer());
    if(representation) {
        representation->render(renderer, transformations);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < this->children.size(); i++) {
        children[i]->render(renderer, transformations, delta);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
