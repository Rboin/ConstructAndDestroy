As shown in \cref{fig:system-overview} the game has no dependency on databases or other servers and services. The game has three high level components: Logic, UI and Renderer. We have chosen this structure because of the Separation of Concern principle. All features of the game can be found in these components. The game is written in C++ and CMake is used for compilation. The unit tests are ran with GMake.
