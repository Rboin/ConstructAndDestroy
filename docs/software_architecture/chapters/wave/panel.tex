\subsection{Panel}
\label{sec:wave-panel}

We've also created a panel that shows information about the waves. It shows 
at which wave we are, the maximum amount of waves, the stat multiplier if 
the wave is spawning entities and the elapsed time. If the wave is in the 
preparation state, the panels shows the time left that you have to prepare.
There's also a button to reset the game, this button resets the player's 
units and the computer's units using the WaveManager class shown in 
\cref{fig:wave}.

To use this panel for states, we used the statemachine pattern. The 
transitions of states are shown in \cref{fig:wavepanel-states}.
