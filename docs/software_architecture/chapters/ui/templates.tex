\subsection{Templated UIComponent}
While creating the GUI library, we've used a lot of templating. This was done 
so that we can reuse our templated GUI classes if and when we decide to 
switch to OpenGL. The lowest level GUI class is called the UIComponent, 
which has a couple of template parameters for which rendering engine we're 
using,  the type of data its rendering object (see \cref{sec:rendering}) 
contains, what kind of data it returns when rendering and the type of data for 
its mouse callback object (which will be explained in 
\cref{sec:eventhandling}).

The UIComponent class can be seen in \cref{fig:uicomponent}.
