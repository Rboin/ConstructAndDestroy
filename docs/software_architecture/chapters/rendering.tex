\section{Rendering}
\label{sec:rendering}

In conjuction with creating our own GUI library, we've also created objects 
that handle the rendering of entities and UIComponents. This class is called 
the RenderObject, which is also a templated class so that we can reuse it 
if and when we decide to switch over to OpenGL rendering.

The Rendering class and its derived classes can be seen in 
\cref{fig:renderobject-inherit}.
