Since we've chosen to use SDL2 as our rendering library, and SDL2 is just a 
microframework used for rendering to a window; we had to create our own GUI 
library. This means that we had to create a way to create and place GUI 
components like panels, buttons and text. This chapter will go in depth on 
how we created our own GUI library and how to use it.
