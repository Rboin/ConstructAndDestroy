\subsection{Flee}
In contrast to the previous behaviours, the FleeBehaviour creates a repulsive 
force which sends the entity away from the target. It looks a lot like the 
seek behaviour except that we check if the distance between us and the target 
exceeds a certain 'panic distance'. If it does, the resulting force equals 
$ \{0, 0, 0\} $. 

The actual force gets calculated by the following equation:
\large
$$ force = \uvec{h} m - v $$
\normalsize

Where $ \uvec{h} $ is our normalized heading vector which points away from 
our target (our position - target position).

As you can see, the FleeBehaviour is actually the opposite of our 
SeekBehaviour. \cite[pg. 92]{buckland}
