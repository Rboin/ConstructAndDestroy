\subsection{Obstacle Avoidance}
With the ObstacleAvoidanceBehaviour class, we try to steer away from the 
first target that enters our avoidance range.\cite[pg. 99]{buckland} 
\\
If there are no targets, the resulting force equals $ \{0, 0, 0\} $.

If there is a target, the resulting force is a normalized heading vector:
\large
$$ force = \uvec{h} $$
\normalsize

Where: 
\large
$$ h = (position + v) - target $$
\normalsize
