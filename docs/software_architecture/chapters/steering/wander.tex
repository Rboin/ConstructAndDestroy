\subsection{Wander}
\label{sec:wander}
The wander force is a force which sends the entity into a random direction, 
based on it's wander\_angle variable. \\
The WanderStrategy projects a circle in front of an entity. The distance 
between this circle and the entity depends on the entity's current velocity. 
It is then normalized and scaled by a distance constant. So in other words; 
you can look at the circle's distance as our heading vector $ \uvec{h} $ on 
which a random (small) change gets applied \cite[pg. 96]{buckland}. 

To calculate the amount of displacement we create a vector $ v = \{ 0, -1\} $
 and scale it by the radius of our projected circle. Then we apply the current 
 wander\_angle variable with the following equation:

 \large
 $$ v = \{ \cos{(\angle wander)} \cdot |v|, \sin{(\angle wander)} \cdot |v| \} $$
 \normalsize

 The wander\_angle variable then gets incremented by another small random 
 number to be used in the next force calculation.

 The actual resulting wandering force is given by:

 \large
 $$ force = \uvec{h} + v $$
 \normalsize
