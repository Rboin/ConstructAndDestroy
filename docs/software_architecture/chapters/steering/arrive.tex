\subsection{Arrive}
The arrive strategy looks a lot like the seek strategy, except that the 
closer we get to our target position the more we get slowed down
\cite[pg. 93]{buckland}. It uses the relation between speed and distance to 
scale our desired velocity. The ArriveStrategy class, like the SeekStrategy 
class, only uses the ArriveStrategy::calculate\_force() method.

The calculation can be represented as:
\large
$$ force = h \cdot (\frac{speed}{distance}) - v $$
\normalsize

Where $ h $ is our heading, $ v $ is our velocity and speed is:
\large
$$ speed = \min (\frac{distance}{deceleration}, max\_speed) $$
\normalsize

The deceleration variable is a constant which can be tweaked to make entities 
slow down more if needed.

If the distance variable is equal to zero, the vector returned by this method 
will just equal $ \{0, 0, 0\} $.
