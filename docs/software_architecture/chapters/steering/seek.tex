\subsection{Seek}
\label{sec:seek-behaviour}
The actual implementation for the seek strategy is actually quite short. The 
SeekStrategy class only uses the SeekStrategy::calculate\_force() method 
provided by the base BehaviourStrategy class.

The SeekStrategy generates an attractive force towards the target. It then 
scales the produces vector by an entity's max speed and subtracts the current 
velocity. \cite[pg. 91]{buckland}

The whole calculation can be represented by: \\
\large 
$$ force = \uvec{h} m - v $$
\normalsize

Where the unit vector $ \uvec{h} $ is the normalized heading (target position - 
our position), $ m $ is our maximum speed and v is our velocity.
