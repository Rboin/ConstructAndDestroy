\subsection{Explore}
\label{sec:explore}
The explore strategy checks if the entity has already explored the map, 
if it did, it already knows the positions of desired objects and can plan a 
path towards one of them. \\
If it did not already explore the map, it generates a path around the map 
which the entity needs to traverse. \\
The path consists of edges of a graph. The way this path gets calculated is 
by creating the longest path through the graph. This way we know that the 
entity will explore the whole map. \\
Lastly, the ExploreBehaviour uses the same calculation as the SeekBehaviour 
(\cref{sec:seek-behaviour}) for the produced force. It basically just moves to 
the next node in it's path.
