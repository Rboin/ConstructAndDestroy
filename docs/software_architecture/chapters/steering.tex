\section{Steering}
Firstly, we're going to give some information about the base steering behaviour
 class. This class is an abstract class of which the other behaviours 
 inherit from. It has two methods, one for setting the targets and another for 
 calculating the produced force.
 \\
 Furthermore, we've applied the Strategy Pattern. We've done this because the 
 different steering behaviours don't differ much from eachother, except for 
 the actual force calculation. \cite{strategy-pattern}

The base BehaviourStrategy class with the different implementations can be 
seen in the appendix at \cref{fig:behaviourstrategy}.
