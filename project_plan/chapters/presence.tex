\section{Presence}
In this chapter we will give insight into the members of the team, the team's presence at school and how we will handle absence.

\subsection{Team}
The team consists of the following members:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sander Bouwman (S1080528)
  \item Stephan Schrijver (S1078783)
  \item Jeroen Vinke (S1078666)
  \item Robin Koning (S1078710)
  \item Mark van der Woude (S1081655)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Presence}
The team will work at school 4 days a week. It depends on the week itself which day we are not working at school. We handle absence by making up for the missed time in our own time. We are all adults and trust each other to keep up with the team.
